Game: The Grid
Link: <Link>

So this is what I was able to come up during this weekend. Not much to show, but I've got the basics working.
It's a basic multiplayer game where players can teleport anywhere in the grid, collect power-ups and attack others.
Planning to introduce more stats and other collectable things for player to build up their stopping power.
Possibly with some resource gathering mechanics with crafting and most basic "base" building (idle mechanics)

Click "Transcend" to teleport to another grid randomly (a bit broken mind you)
If you run out of magicka just commit a suicide!

I can implement any feature at this point so if you have something in your mind please share, I'll be grateful.

If you're curious to try the "combat" (and no one's online) you can open another browser tab in incognito mode to get yourself a dummy opponent.

LEGEND:
green box - You are here!
red box - other player. Click to attack. Health in percent shown
yellow box - click to teleport and pickup
    H - healing potion
    M - magic potion

TODO:
* world serialization (so that everything can persist after server reset or crash)
* attack and defence power-ups
* notification when you get git by somebody
* some sort of leveling system (have to clarify)
* basic error logging and analytics (server and client)
* icons instead of characters (grid)
